This application is my Final Report for Anglia Ruskin University. The specific app, called "Safety For Everyone," is my first project using Kotlin, created with the intention of providing a useful tool for people seeking enhanced personal safety.

Features of the Safety For Everyone Application:

User-Friendly Design: The application features a simple, single-page layout without the need for login or registration, ensuring ease of use for everyone.

GPS Technology Integration: Users can share their real-time location with designated contacts directly from their mobile phoneâ€™s contacts. This feature works even without an internet connection, leveraging GPS technology.

Multiple Contact Listings: Users can save multiple contacts or create new entries by filling in the relevant name and phone number, making it easy to reach out to trusted individuals in an emergency.

SOS Message Sending: With the press of a single button, users can send their GPS location via an SOS message. Additionally, the app includes a shake detector function that sends the SOS message automatically when intense motion is detected.

Shake Detector Activation: In situations where pressing a button might not be feasible, the shake detector automatically sends an SOS message with the user's GPS location to emergency contacts when intense motion is detected.

Siren Activation: For added safety, the phone will activate a loud siren at maximum volume, even if the smartphone is in silent mode. This occurs simultaneously with the sending of the SOS message or activation of the shake detector, drawing attention to the user's situation.

I created this app to provide a reliable and easy-to-use safety tool for anyone in need. The combination of user-friendly design, essential safety features, and the innovative use of technology makes "Safety For Everyone" a valuable addition to personal safety applications.
