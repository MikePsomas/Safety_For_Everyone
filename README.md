This application is my Final Report For Anglia Ruskin University
The specific App called Safety For Everyone
That's my first time using Kotlin 
I created this app so ppl can use it if they want
The features of the proposed Safety for Everyone application are the following:
•	User-friendly design, the application is made as simple as possible being a single-page layout without the requirement for a login or a registration, 
•	Use of GPS technology, the user can easily share his/her location in real-time with the designated contacts of his/her choice from the corresponding contacts of the mobile phone without the need for having access to internet connection,
•	Listing of multiple contacts, the user can save multiple contacts or create a new contact entry by filling out the relevant name and phone number,
•	Sending an SOS message, the user can send his/her GPS location through an SOS message with the press of one button or without it via the use of the shake detector function,
•	Shake detector activation, an SOS message is automatically sent to the emergency contact(s) with the GPS location of the person in need without pressing any buttons when intense motion is detected and,
•	Siren activation, the phone will enable the function of a siren at maximum volume even if the smartphone is in silent mode at the same time when the SOS message is sent or when the shake detector is activated.
